# snack-or-booze


The homepage should show the # of food items (“snacks”) and drink choices (“drinks”)

The navbar should add a new link, “Drinks”, leading to a page listing the drinks — just like the “Snacks” link leads to a page listing food items.

The drink listing page should show a list of drink choices, with each being a link to the details about the drink, just like for food items.
